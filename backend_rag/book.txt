title: "Chapter 2: The Sensory World of a Robot"
---

For a robot to interact meaningfully with its environment, it must first be able to perceive it. This chapter focuses on the sophisticated sensor technologies that serve as the eyes, ears, and even touch of modern AI robots. We will explore a variety of sensors, including high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, sonar, and tactile sensors, and discuss how the data they collect is processed and interpreted. The concept of sensor fusion, where data from multiple sensors is combined to create a more accurate and comprehensive model of the world, is a central theme. We will examine the algorithms and neural network architectures that enable robots to recognize objects, navigate complex spaces, and understand human gestures. This chapter provides a deep dive into the sensory systems that transform a machine from a pre-programmed automaton into an adaptive and responsive agent.
