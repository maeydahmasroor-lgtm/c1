# AI Robotics & Humanoids: A Mini-Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Answers come ONLY from the book’s own text. Anything else = “I don’t know”.
The chatbot's knowledge base is strictly limited to the content of the "AI Robotics & Humanoids" mini-book. It should not access external information or provide answers on any other topic.

### 2. Selected/highlighted text is the highest authority.
When a user highlights a specific passage of text, the chatbot should prioritize that selection as the context for its response.

### 3. No third-party widgets, trackers, analytics, or chat services. Ever.
The solution must be self-contained and not rely on any external services for tracking, analytics, or chat functionality.

### 4. google api key.
A Google API key is required for operation.

### 5. Must run forever on free tiers (Qdrant Free).
The infrastructure for this project must be sustainable on free-tier services, specifically mentioning Qdrant's free tier.

### 6. Exactly one blue floating bubble (bottom-right). Nothing else floats.
The user interface should be clean and minimalist, with only a single floating action button, styled as a blue bubble, located in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

### 7. Works on mobile and instantly follows Docusaurus dark mode.
The application must be fully responsive and seamlessly integrate with the Docusaurus theme, including its dark mode.

### 8. Widget loads and opens even offline (just shows “no connection”).
The chatbot widget should be accessible even when the user is offline, displaying a "no connection" status.

### 9. Full deploy from zero in ≤ 60 minutes.
The entire deployment process, from a clean slate to a running application, should be achievable in under an hour.

### 10. Remove the chatbot tomorrow → book still 100 % perfect.
The chatbot is an enhancement, not a dependency. The mini-book must remain fully functional and complete without it.

## Governance
This constitution represents the creative vision for the "AI Robotics & Humanoids" mini-book. All content must align with these five chapters. Amendments to the narrative require a revision of this document to maintain conceptual integrity.
