# Integrated RAG Chatbot Development: A Mini-Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot
Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the published book.

### 2. Technology Stack
Utilize the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier.

### 3. Core Functionality
The chatbot must be able to answer user questions about the book's content, including answering questions based only on text selected by the user.

## Governance
This constitution represents the creative vision for the "Integrated RAG Chatbot Development" mini-book. All content must align with these three principles. Amendments to the narrative require a revision of this document to maintain conceptual integrity.
